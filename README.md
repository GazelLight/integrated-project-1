**A successful game**


I work for an online gaming company called Ice, they sell video games all over the world. My job is to fined patterns that will help the company identify games that will be successful. To help me reach my goal, the company has provided me with a table that contains a list of games, its genres and platforms, how many copies of each game where sold in different regions and, user and critic scores, and the games ESRB rating.
